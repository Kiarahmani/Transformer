! state is unstable (in the middle of writing extractWhClause in the query compiling part) -> NPE occurs because many of the datastructures
  at the query are still null and need to be extracted (or trivially intialized)
+ new understanding that loops can be trivially handled
+ more advancement on the structure of the compiler (basically must start from some special assignments and create appropriate statements)
+ some progress made in extracting queries from String to query data structure 
+ next commit must include some advancement in the structure of the ir.expressions and completion of the query extraction

! stable
+ some progress made in the structure of the expressions
--- my expressions toString done
--- additional expressions defined 
--- UnOp and BinOp expressions structurized  
+ whereClause successfully translated to my expressions

! Stable
+ Query extraction finished and some initial tests passed
+ Some parts of the extraction are not ideal but hopefully should be fine for now
--- e.g. for some reason, I was not able to use string literals in the queries and kept getting an exception from
    JSQLParser. Thus, the extractor treats JSQLParser's column identifiers as Strings and types are also matched with
    already extracted table (basically not receiving any type information from JSQLParser)
+ next I should move to assignments
