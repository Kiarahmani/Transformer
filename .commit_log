! state is unstable (in the middle of writing extractWhClause in the query compiling part) -> NPE occurs because many of the datastructures
  at the query are still null and need to be extracted (or trivially intialized)
+ new understanding that loops can be trivially handled
+ more advancement on the structure of the compiler (basically must start from some special assignments and create appropriate statements)
+ some progress made in extracting queries from String to query data structure 
+ next commit must include some advancement in the structure of the ir.expressions and completion of the query extraction
